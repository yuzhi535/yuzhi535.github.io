Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a first-year M.Sc. at HAVPR Lab(Human Activity & Visual Perception Research Lab) at Wuhan University, supervised by Prof. Zhigang Tu. My M.Sc. research interests mainly focus on Knowledge distillation, tiny object detection and moving object detection.

I graduated with an B.Eng from the Zhengzhou University in 2023 with the honours degree and outstanding student award. I majored in Software Engineering, where I became interested in computer vision and learned about object detection. Because of my undergraduate performance, I was recommended to study for a masterâ€™s degree in computer application technology at Wuhan University. Contact me by [Email](mailto:@zhouyuxi.abc@gmail.com).
